    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);
    // the age variable has been updated, so the second console.log reflects this update


    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);



    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log('players', players, 'team', team);
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; 
        // the original also gets updated ~ this is the exact same issue that I came across when I was making the studio ghibli app!

      // however what happens when we update that array?


    // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy.   They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; //will take every item and put it in this new empty array
    console.log('team4', team4, 'players', players);

    team4[4] = 'Arby';
    console.log('team4', team4, 'players', players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(person); //you will see that the person object also shows the same update because it is a reference and not a clone/copy

  
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 108, age:12}); //so we have 3 different parts that we include within the smooth brackets, and that is the empty object property, the object we want to clone, and the new properties that we want to include
    console.log('cap2', cap2);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap4 = {...person}; //THIS DOES NOT EXIST YET

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // or you can cheat and do this:

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log('wes Object', wes);

    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

    dev.age = 24;

    console.log('dev', dev);
